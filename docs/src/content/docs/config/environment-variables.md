Some parts of the build can be configured with environment variables. These are
often prefixed with `RAILPACK_`.

## Build Configuration

| Name                           | Description                                                                                                |
| :----------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RAILPACK_BUILD_CMD`           | Set the command to run for the build step. This overwrites any commands that come from providers           |
| `RAILPACK_START_CMD`           | Set the command to run when the container starts                                                           |
| `RAILPACK_PACKAGES`            | Install additional Mise packages. In the format `pkg@version`. The latest version is used if not provided. |
| `RAILPACK_BUILD_APT_PACKAGES`  | Install additional Apt packages during build                                                               |
| `RAILPACK_DEPLOY_APT_PACKAGES` | Install additional Apt packages in the final image                                                         |

To configure more parts of the build, it is recommended to use a [config file](/config/file).

## Global Options

These environment variables affect the behavior of Railpack:

| Name          | Description                                 |
