<Aside type="note" title="Beta file format">
  The config file format is not yet finalized and subject to change.
</Aside>

Railpack will look for a `railpack.json` file in the root of the directory being
built. You can override this by setting the `RAILPACK_CONFIG_FILE` environment
variable to a path relative to the directory being built.

If found, that configuration will be used to change how the plan is built.

A config file looks something like this:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.railpack.com",
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "install",
      "commands": ["npm install"]
    },
    {
      "name": "build",
      "inputs": [{ "step": "install" }],
      "commands": ["...", "./my-custom-build.sh"]
    }
  ],
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "node dist/index.js"
  }
}
```

## Inputs

Inputs define where a step gets its filesystem from. They can be:

- Another step's output
- A Docker image
- Local files

The first input must not have any include or exclude options as it is the base
filesystem.

Inputs are used both for steps and for the deploy section. For example, the
inputs of a Node build might looks like this:

```json
"deploy": {
  "inputs": [
    {
      "image": "ghcr.io/railwayapp/railpack-runtime:latest"
    },
    {
      "step": "packages:mise",
      "include": [
        "/mise/shims",
        "/mise/installs",
        // ...
      ]
    },
    {
      "step": "build",
      "include": ["."]
    },
    {
      "local": true,
      "include": ["."]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step Input

Use another step's output as input:

```json
{
  "step": "install",
  "include": ["."], // "." represents the working directory (/app)
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

### Image Input

Use a Docker image as input:

```json
{
  "image": "macabees/neofetch",
  "include": ["/usr/bin/neofetch"]
}
```

### Local Input

Use local files as input:

```json
{
  "local": true,
  "include": ["."]
}
```

### Input Options

All input types support these options:

| Field     | Description                                             |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `include` | Files or directories to include                         |
| `exclude` | Files or directories to exclude                         |
| `spread`  | Whether to spread the input into the current filesystem |

## Array Extending

You can use the `...` special syntax to extend arrays in the configuration. This
is useful when you want to add items to an existing array rather than override
it completely.

For example:

```json
{
  "steps": {
    "build": {
      // Runs ./my-custom-build.sh after the auto-generated build commands
      "commands": ["...", "./my-custom-build.sh"]
    }
  },
  "deploy": {
    "inputs": [
      "...",

      // Copies the neofetch binary into the final image on top of the auto-generated image
      { "image": "macabees/neofetch", "include": ["/usr/bin/neofetch"] }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Root Configuration

The root configuration can have these fields:

| Field              | Description                                                                     |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `provider`         | The provider to use for deployment (optional, autodetected by default)          |
| `buildAptPackages` | List of apt packages to install during the build step                           |
| `packages`         | Map of package name to package version                                          |
| `caches`           | Map of cache name to cache definitions. The cache names are referenced in steps |
| `secrets`          | List of secrets that should be made available to commands                       |
| `steps`            | Map of step names to step definitions                                          |


For example:

```json
{
  "provider": "node",
  "buildAptPackages": ["git", "curl"],
  "packages": {
    "node": "22",
    "python": "3.13"
  },
}
```

## Caches

Caches are used to speed up builds by storing and reusing files between builds.
Each cache has a type and a directory. Caches **are not persisted** in the final
image.

The cache name is referenced in the `caches` field of a step. A cache has the
following properties:

| Field       | Description                                                           |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `directory` | The directory to cache                                                |
| `type`      | The type of cache (either "shared" or "locked", defaults to "shared") |

For example:

```json
{
  "caches": {
    "npm-install": {
      "directory": "/root/.npm",
      "type": "shared"
    },
    "apt": {
      "directory": "/var/cache/apt",
      "type": "locked"
    }
  }
}
```

### Cache Types

- `shared`: Multiple builds can use this cache simultaneously (used for package
  manager caches)
- `locked`: Only one build can use this cache at a time (used for apt caches to
  prevent concurrent package installations)

## Steps

Each step in the build process can have:

| Field       | Description                                                             |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inputs`    | List of inputs for this step (from other steps, images, or local files) |
| `commands`  | List of commands to run in this step                                    |
| `secrets`   | List of secrets that this step uses                                     |
| `assets`    | Mapping of name to file contents referenced in file commands            |
| `variables` | Mapping of name to variable values referenced in variable commands      |
| `caches`    | List of cache IDs available to all commands in this step                |

## Commands

A list of commands to run in a step. For example:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    // Copy the package.json file from the local context into the build
    { "src": "package.json", "dest": "package.json" },

    // Install dependencies
    {
      "cmd": "npm install",
      "customName": "Install dependencies"
    }

    // Make the node_modules/.bin directory available in the PATH
    { "path": "node_modules/.bin" }
  ]
}
```

### Exec command

Executes a shell command during the build (e.g. 'go build' or 'npm install').

| Field        | Description                                      |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `cmd`        | The shell command to execute                     |
| `customName` | Optional custom name to display for this command |

If the command is a string, it is assumed to be an exec command in the format
`sh -c '<cmd>'`.

### Path command

Adds a directory to the global PATH environment variable. This path will be
available to all subsequent commands in the build.

| Field  | Description                                                   |
| :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `path` | Directory path to add to the global PATH environment variable |

### Copy command

local context.

| Field   | Description                                             |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `image` | Optional source image to copy from (e.g. 'node:18')     |
| `src`   | Source path to copy from (file or directory)            |
| `dest`  | Destination path to copy to (will be created if needed) |

### File command

Creates or modifies a file during the build with optional Unix file permissions.

| Field        | Description                                             |

| `mode`       | Optional Unix file permissions mode (e.g. 0644)         |
| `customName` | Optional custom name to display for this file operation |

### String format

Commands can also be specified using a string format:

- `npm install` - Executes the command
- `PATH:/usr/local/bin` - Adds to PATH
- `COPY:src dest` - Copies files

## Deploy

The deploy section configures how the container runs:

| Field          | Description                                                             |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `aptPackages`  | List of Apt packages to install in the final image                      |

## Schema

The schema for the config file is available at https://schema.railpack.com. Add
it to your `railpack.json` to get autocomplete and validation in your editor.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.railpack.com"
